# Logitech-G13-Lighting-Effects
LUA Scripting for LGS to add basic lighting effects to the Logitech G13 Gamepad.

This will allow you to add a Color Cycle and a Breathe effect similar to the basic lighting effects on similar Logitech devices.
Note that with this script running, no other scripts will be able to run for that active profile within Logitech Gaming Software.

To add, download the .lua script and launch the Logitech Gaming Software interface.
Select the Logitech G13 device on the bottom , then select Customize G-Keys.
For the profile you wish to add the script to, click the arrow to bring the drop down list and select Scripting.
On the new pop up window, select Script > Import and navigate to where you saved the file.
Upon importing the file and accepting to replace your current script, the script will be loaded.

You may configure the script by adjusting the variables at the top. You may select which effect to use at start, as well as configure how bright you want the backlighting to be, and how fast you want it to cycle through the colors. You may even set the LEDs to turn off after a set period of time and allow them to turn back on from mouse movement.

Once you make changes to the variables, select Script > Save (or hit Ctrl + S) to save the script and automatically run with the changes you've made.

As a fail safe you may stop the script by pressing any of the non selected M keys at the top of the Gamepad. Alternatively, if you wish to test the effects without having the script run at startup you may hit Ctrl on your keyboard + G20 on the gamepad to turn on the Color Cycle, or Ctrl + G21 to turn on the breathing effect. You will not be able to switch lighting effects without stopping the current effect first by hitting the M keys.
